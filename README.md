# BloodShare

Connect. Donate. Save lives.

BloodShare is an web application that connects blood donors and blood donees to make blood donation easy with the motto of Connect. Donate. Save lives. This app helps find a donor whenever needed, allows blood donors and blood donees to schedule appointments, and tracks donation history. By joining the BloodShare community, donors and donees become part of a movement to save lives and make a difference in their communities.

Our key feature is,
- Find a donor whenever needed.
- Schedule donation appointments.
- Managing blood donation as a process.
- Tracks donation history to notify the user for the donation time.
